# personapi

This application was generated using JHipster 6.10.1, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.10.1](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.10.1).

This is a "microservice" application intended to be part of a microservice architecture, please refer to the [Doing microservices with JHipster][] page of the documentation for more information.

This application is configured for Service Discovery and Configuration with . On launch, it will refuse to start if it is not able to connect to .

## Development

To start your application in the dev profile, run:

```
./mvnw
```

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the personapi application for production, run:

```

./mvnw -Pprod clean verify


```

To ensure everything worked, run:

```

java -jar target/*.jar


```

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```

./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify


```

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw verify
```

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
```

Then run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.
